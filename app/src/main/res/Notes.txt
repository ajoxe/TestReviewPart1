Recycler view - launching Intents

Recycler View
 - model
 - viewholder
 -adapter
 -packages (to organize your files)

 -Models are most necessary for mapping Json to data classes, can build a recycler view that contains strings.
 get recylcer view dependencies.
 //cmd + E lets you go through your files, cmd + w Closes the tab


 Fragments -
 support fragment - backwards compatible works with older api's ( v4) have to make sure every other fragment is support
 regular fragment only workd up util api 19
 on Attach - attach to activity
 onCreate - creates fragment
 onCreateView - inflates layout views
 onDestroy View
 onDetach - removes it from the activity

 fragment has mind of its own, it can be at any state irrelevant to state of activity. Can create bugs from fragment lifecylce
